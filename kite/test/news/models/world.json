      "title": "Heathrow Airport resumes operations after fire shutdown",
      "short_summary": "London's Heathrow Airport is fully operational again after a fire at an electrical substation forced its closure for most of Friday, causing global travel disruption. The shutdown affected approximately 1,350 flights and stranded 200,000 passengers, with the airport now deploying additional staff and scheduling extra flights to accommodate 10,000 more passengers on Saturday, though airlines warn disruptions will continue for days.",
      "did_you_know": "Heathrow Airport serves around 230,000 passengers every day — 83 million a year — making it one of the world's busiest airports with flights to approximately 80 countries.",
      "talking_points": [
        "Power outage cause: The fire started Thursday night at an electrical substation located about 2 miles away from the airport, taking firefighters around seven hours to bring under control.",
        "Global impact: The closure of Europe's busiest air hub caused worldwide travel chaos as planes were diverted to other airports across Britain and Europe while many long-haul flights returned to their departure points.",
        "Recovery efforts: British Airways expects to operate about 85% of its scheduled flights on Saturday, while restrictions on overnight flights have been temporarily lifted to help ease the backlog of passengers.",
        "Infrastructure concerns: The incident has raised serious questions about the vulnerability of critical UK infrastructure and the adequacy of contingency plans at one of the world's major transportation hubs.",
        "Investigation focus: Police do not consider the fire suspicious, with the London Fire Brigade indicating their investigation will focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation."
      ],
      "quote": "This is unprecedented. It's never happened before and that's why I'm saying it has been a major incident. I mean, short of anybody getting hurt, this is as big as it gets for our airport and we are actually coming back quite fast I would say, when you consider the amount of systems that we have to shut down then bring back up and make sure that they're safe.",
